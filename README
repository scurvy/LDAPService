Setup
------
Right now this expects you check it out in /srv/lds
Then run 'sudo rake apache'

From there you should be ok.




Just some thoughts

User Interface Management
- Set Shell - read from available shells in yaml?
- Set Phone number - mulitple types (check the LDAP Schema)
- upload SSH Key (cfmgmt to dist on the back side)
- set preferred email
- allow password reset
- temp password reset
- set password encryption type in yaml config
