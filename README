LDAPService
-------------
LDAPService or lds as I am currently calling it, is a tool to allow for user
self-management and password recovery based a fairly typical LDAP setup.

The setup assumes you have users in an objectclass that contains 'userPassword' 
as the attribute that contains their password and that 'self-write' is enabled
on that attribute.  Most everything else is configurable in the configuration
file, which is simple YAML.

This project allows for:
* Self service of any self-writable attribute
* Password Recovery if a password is forgotten

Status
-------
Project is still pre-alpha.  It has some basic functionality, but bugs are 
probably quite common.  Also, the TODO list is growing quite long.
