Setup
------
Right now this expects you check it out in /srv/lds
Then run 'sudo rake httpd' on Fedora/RHEL/Centos
or 'sudo rake apache2' on Debian

* Install the proper Packages
* Ensure you can send email from the system
* Update your configuration file
* 

From there you should be ok.


Just some thoughts

User Interface Management
- Set Shell - read from available shells in yaml?
- Set Phone number - mulitple types (check the LDAP Schema)
- upload SSH Key (cfmgmt to dist on the back side)
- set preferred email
- allow password reset
- temp password reset
- set password encryption type in yaml config
