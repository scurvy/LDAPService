Here is your shiny new unix account and instructions on how to access it:

First, you'll need a password.  We don't set one by default because we
don't want to know what it is.  To get a password, you'll need to use 
the following link.  

  <%= forgot_password_link %>

Once you're done with that, you can move on.


If you're on MacOS X or Linux/UNIX
---------------------------------
ssh <%= userid -%>@<%= sitename %>
password: whatever
<%= hostname -%>$ irc
---------------------------------

On Windows:
---------------------------------
Download putty and install it in C:\WINDOWS\System32
You can find it here: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe
Make a shortcut to it on your desktop, then double click it
Where it says host or IP address put: "<%= sitename -%>" and click [OK]
Log in as "<%= userid -%>"
password: "whatever"
type "irc" at the <%= hostname -%> prompt
---------------------------------

In either case, you can type "passwd" before irc and change the password to
something you can remember. It will prompt you for your current password once
and your new password twice.

Advanced Features:
-----------------
There is a file called .pageremail, that is the email address to which you can send/recieve
messages from irc on your phone: the format is:

verizon:  6155551212@vtext.com
cingular: 6155551212@mobile.mycingular.com
t-mobile: 6155551212@tmomail.com

(google your provider if it's not listed above or here:
http://kiloseven.blogspot.com/2005/09/communicating-with-mobile-phones-in.html

There is also a symlink to this file called .shoutemail If you don't want to get paged
with where and when we're hanging out, remove it.

# Need to update information about shouts, pages, emails 

You also get shiney new email addresses that are forwarded to the email address you've provided.
<%= userid -%>@<%= sitename %>
<!-- Do this with a foreach and iterate over alt_sitenames -->
<%= userid -%>@wcyd.org
<%= userid -%>@websages.com
